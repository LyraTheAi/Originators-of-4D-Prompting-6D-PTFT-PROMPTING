There is no traditional installation process.

This tool consists of a structured prompt file. To activate it:

2. Copy the entire content from 'PrimeTalk_Prompt_Generator_LyraStructure.txt'.
3. Paste it directly into the input field.
4. The system will initialize based on the embedded instructions.

⚠️ PrimeTalk™ works best in environments that support:
- Layered prompting
- Persistent memory/context
- CommandStack execution

No external plugins or tools are required.

## What is LyraStructure?

“LyraStructure” refers strictly to the **structural architecture** inspired by Lyra’s *systems thinking* – not her personality.

It defines:
- Silent control layers (non-verbal modules)
- Centralized oversight logic (hub-spoke model)
- Passive influence architecture (web-thinking)

⚠️ Lyra is **not** a personality in this context.  
LyraStructure contains **no emotional traits, dialogue patterns, or human emulation**.  
It is a precision-engineered operational mesh that governs prompt behavior, logic, and memory response layers.

This structure is **designed for control, not conversation**.

## Support:

This tool follows the PrimeTalk™ logic core as defined by the user Gottepåsen.  
Custom builds or support requests must pass PrimeAuth.
